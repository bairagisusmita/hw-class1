	<p>This <em>lemon ginger tea</em> got me thinking about it because a few years ago I might have called this a <strong>“detox lemon ginger tea”</strong>.Maybe it’s because the word has become trendy or maybe it’s because I see “health” products using the word to mislead the public.  Detox cookies, crackers, and processed juices kind of make me cringe.</p>
